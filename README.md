# Welcome To Antsweeper!

This game recreates Windows 98 Minesweeper (but with ants - I garden a lot) using React and some concepts introduced by React hooks.  I love reverse-engineering games and ideas using JavaScript, and I also love Minesweeper, so this was bound to happen eventually.

I've been working on this project casually in my free time as I study my way back through React hooks, so it may be missing features when you see it.

## Planned future additions include:

* Fixing up the CSS to be mobile-responsive, especially at levels above beginner
* Reorganization of the "logic" files
* User's highest score functionality using localstorage.
* And maybe... a backend element that preserves all high scores and takes a high scorer's name

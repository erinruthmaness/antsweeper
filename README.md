# Welcome To Antsweeper (hopefully)!

As I learn React hooks and other cool tips from Maximilien Schwarzm√ºller's updated React course on Udemy, I really want to practice some of this stuff for myself, so I thought it might be fun to try to figure out how to build a Minesweeper game!  But since I enjoy using emojis instead of uploading images, and inspired by some recent gardening projects I've undertaken, I'm replacing the bombs with ants.  One of those "don't step on the anthill" concepts I guess.

Watch this space and see what I figure out!
